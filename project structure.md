/frontend: Contains the React Native mobile app. Organized by components, screens, navigation, and store for state management (using Redux or Context API). The services folder will include API requests to the backend, keeping the code modular and clean.

/backend: Houses the Node.js backend with Express.js setup, organized by models (for MongoDB schemas), controllers (API logic), and routes (API endpoints). This setup keeps each API route and its logic isolated, making it easy to add new features.

/deploy: This folder includes deployment configurations such as Docker for containerization, docker-compose.yml for local development, and Firebase or Vercel configurations. If you plan to use Kubernetes later, the k8s folder can store YAML files for deploying and managing clusters.

.env: Stores sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database URLs) for easy configuration and secure access.
